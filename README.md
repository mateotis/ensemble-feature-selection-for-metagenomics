# Feature selection and an ensemble framework for metagenomic data
This repository contains all my data and experimental results for my MSc thesis at ELTE, *Feature selection and an ensemble framework for metagenomic data.*

The code is available in a Jupyter notebook on Colab [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1gaxtg3_LsFtqZR15Pm75c-kCEZd55s36/view?usp=sharing). There are instructions in the notebook to get you set up and running the framework. Enjoy!
